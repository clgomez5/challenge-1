# challenge-1

## Description

This weekâ€™s challenge, I was tasked with refactoring code. I was given starter code to review, so that I
could assess how the existing code could be improved. To do this, I reviewed the code and replaced all
the div elements with Semantic HTML tags and adjusted the CSS as necessary to correspond with the
new Semantic HTML elements. I learned that it is best to try and use semantic HTML elements when
coding as it makes reading code easier to read and follow. The div element should and can be used as a
last resort should there be no other suitable element.
